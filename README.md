A timeout manager can be a useful tool for managing and monitoring the behavior of applications and systems. Here are some features that you might want to consider when building a timeout manager:

1. Customizable timeout periods: The ability to set custom timeout periods for applications or processes can help you fine-tune the behavior of your system. This allows you to adjust the timeout periods based on specific use cases or performance requirements.

2. Thresholds and alerts: The ability to set thresholds and receive alerts when a timeout occurs can help you quickly identify and troubleshoot issues in your system.

3. Dashboard and reporting: A dashboard or reporting feature that provides real-time data on system performance, including timeout events and the status of applications or processes, can help you better understand and optimize the behavior of your system.

4. Integration with other tools: Integration with other monitoring and management tools can help you streamline your workflow and improve the efficiency of your system.

5. Customizable actions: The ability to define custom actions to take when a timeout occurs, such as restarting a process or sending an alert to a specific user or group, can help you automate your system management tasks and improve your response time to issues.

6. Audit logs: The ability to track and record timeout events and other system activity can help you identify patterns and trends over time, and can be useful for auditing and compliance purposes.

These are just a few features that you might want to consider when building a timeout manager. Depending on your specific needs and use cases, you may want to include additional features or functionality.
